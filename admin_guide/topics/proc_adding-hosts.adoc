= Adding hosts

You can add new hosts to your cluster by running the *_scaleup.yml_* playbook.
This playbook queries the master, generates and distributes new certificates for
the new hosts, then runs the configuration playbooks on the new hosts only.
Before running the *_scaleup.yml_* playbook, complete all prerequisite
xref:../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#install-config-install-host-preparation[host
preparation] steps.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The scaleup playbook only configures the new host. It does not update *_NO_PROXY_* in master services and it does not restart master services.
====

You must have an existing inventory file (for example, *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*)
that is representative of your current cluster configuration in order to run the
*_scaleup.yml_* playbook.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you previously used the `atomic-openshift-installer` command to run your
installation, you can check *_~/.config/openshift/hosts_* (previously located at
*_~/.config/openshift/.ansible/hosts_*) for the last inventory file that the
installer generated, and use or modify that as needed as your inventory file.
You must then specify the file location with `-i` when calling
`ansible-playbook` later.

limits] section for recommended maximum number of nodes.

== Procedure

. Ensure you have the latest playbooks by updating the *atomic-openshift-utils*
package:
+
----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

. Edit your *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file and add *new_<host_type>* to the
*[OSEv3:children]* section:
+
For example, to add a new node host, add *new_nodes*:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes
new_nodes
----
+
To add new master hosts, add *new_masters*.

. Create a *[new_<host_type>]* section much like an existing section,
specifying host information for any new hosts you want to add. For example,
when adding a new node:
+
----
[nodes]
master[1:3].example.com
node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'east'}"
node2.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}"
infra-node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra', 'zone': 'default'}"
infra-node2.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra', 'zone': 'default'}"

[new_nodes]
node3.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}"
----
+
See
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#advanced-host-variables[Configuring
Host Variables] for more options.
+
When adding new masters, hosts added to the *[new_masters]* section must also be
added to the *[new_nodes]* section. This ensures the new master host is part of
the OpenShift SDN.
+
----
[masters]
master[1:2].example.com

[new_masters]
master3.example.com

[nodes]
master[1:2].example.com
node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'east'}"
node2.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}"
infra-node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra', 'zone': 'default'}"
infra-node2.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra', 'zone': 'default'}"

[new_nodes]
master3.example.com
----
+
Masters are also automatically marked as unschedulable for pod placement by the
installer.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you label a master host with the `region=infra` label and have no other
dedicated infrastructure nodes, you must also explicitly mark the host as
schedulable by adding `openshift_schedulable=true` to the entry. Otherwise, the
registry and router pods cannot be placed anywhere.
====

. Run the *_scaleup.yml_* playbook. If your inventory file is located somewhere
other than the default of *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, specify the location with the
`-i option`.
+
For additional nodes:
+
----
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/file] \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-node/scaleup.yml
----
+
For additional masters:
+
----
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/file] \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-master/scaleup.yml
----

. After the playbook completes successfully,
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#advanced-verifying-the-installation[verify the installation].

. Finally, move any hosts you had defined in the *[new_<host_type>]* section
into their appropriate section (but leave the *[new_<host_type>]* section
definition itself in place) so that subsequent runs using this inventory file
are aware of the nodes but do not handle them as new nodes. For example, when
adding new nodes:
+
----
[nodes]
master[1:3].example.com
node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'east'}"
node2.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}"
node3.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}"
infra-node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra', 'zone': 'default'}"
infra-node2.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra', 'zone': 'default'}"
