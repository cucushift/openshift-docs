== Overview

In {product-title}, you can _restore_, recreating state from separate storage,
at the cluster level.

To restore a cluster, you must first xref:../day_two_guide/environment_backup.adoc[back it up].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following process describes a generic way of restoring applications and the
{product-title} cluster. It cannot take into account custom requirements. You 
might need to take additional actions to restore your cluster.

== Adding an etcd node

After you restore etcd, you can add more etcd nodes to the cluster. You can 
either add an etcd host by using an Ansible playbook or by manual steps.
