= Restoring Persistent Volume Claims

This topic describes two methods for restoring data. The first involves deleting
the file, then placing the file back in the expected location. The second
example shows migrating persistent volume claims. The migration would occur in
the event that the storage needs to be moved or in a disaster scenario when the
backend storage no longer exists.

Check with the restore procedures for the specific application on any steps
required to restore data to the application.
