[[ocp-310-about-this-release]]
== About This Release

Red Hat {product-title} version 3.10
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:0489[RHBA-2018:0489]) is now
available. This release is based on
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v3.10.0[OpenShift
Origin 3.10]. New features, changes, bug fixes, and known issues that pertain to
{product-title} 3.10 are included in this topic.

{product-title} 3.10 is supported on RHEL 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 with the latest packages
from Extras, including Docker 1.13. It is also supported on Atomic Host 7.4.5
and newer. The *docker-latest* package is now deprecated.

TLSV1.2 is the only supported security version in {product-title} version 3.4
and later. You must update if you are using TLSV1.0 or TLSV1.1.

For initial installations, see the
xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[Installing Clusters] documentation.

To upgrade to this release from a previous version, see the
xref:../upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[Upgrading Clusters]
documentation.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-major-changes-to-cluster-architecture]]
=== Major Changes to Cluster Architecture

{product-title} 3.10 introduces major architecture changes in how control
plane and node components are deployed, affecting new installations and upgrades
from {product-title} 3.9.

.Cluster architecture changes during upgrade
image::ocp310-archupgrade.png["Cluster architecture changes during upgrade"]

The following sections highlight the most significant changes, with more detail
provided in the Architecture Guide.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-control-plane-changes]]
==== Control Plane as Static Pods

While previously run as systemd services, the control plane components
(apiserver, controllers, and etcd when co-located with a master) are now run as
static pods by the kubelet on master hosts.

This is now the only supported way they can be run; system containers are no
longer supported, with the exception of the node service RHEL Atomic Host. The
upgrade will change over to the new architecture automatically. Control plane
components continue to read configurations from the *_/etc/origin/master/_* and
*_/etc/etcd/_* directories.

You can see the pods after the control plane starts using `oc get pods -n kube-system`, 
and `exec`, `log`, and `inspect` them using normal `oc` CLI commands.

[discrete]
===== Why?

Static pods are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node,
without the API server having to observe it. With this simplified architecture,
master and node static pods do not have an associated replication controller,
and the kubelet daemon itself watches and restarts them if they crash. Static
pods are always bound to one kubelet daemon and always run on the same node with
it.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-nodes-bootstrapped]]
==== Nodes Bootstrapped from the Master

Nodes are now bootstrapped from the master by default, which means nodes will
pull their pre-defined configuration and client and server certificates from the
master. The 3.10 upgrade will automatically transform your nodes to use this new
mode.

The node components *openshift-sdn* and *openvswitch* are now run using a
DaemonSet instead of a systemd service.

[discrete]
===== Why?

The goal for bootstrapping is to allow faster node start-up by reducing the
differences between nodes, as well as centralizing more configuration and
letting the cluster converge on the desired state. This enables certificate
rotation and centralized certificate management by default (use `oc get csr` to see
pending certificates).

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-containerized-installation-removed]]
==== Containerized Installation Method Removed

The containerized installation method for OpenShift Container Platform (where
components run as standard container images) has been removed and is no longer
supported starting in 3.10. The 3.10 upgrade migrates RHEL Server hosts to the
RPM-based method and RHEL Atomic Hosts to the system container-based method (for
the node service only), which are the only supported methods for the respective
RHEL variants.

[discrete]
===== Why?

This reduces the number of installation and upgrade paths, and aligns better
with features to be introduced in future releases.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-configuration-files]]
==== Configuration Files

To upgrade from {product-title} 3.9 to 3.10, you must first create
a configuration file that maps your previous master and node configurations to
the new ConfigMap usage, and supply the mapping when initiating your cluster
upgrade. This ensures that the upgrade does not begin without this critical
information, and that you are not left at the end of the upgrade with hosts
using the previous style deployment.

In addition, the *_/etc/sysconfig/(origin|atomic-openshift)-(api|controllers)_*
files will no longer be used. A new *_/etc/origin/master/master.env_* file can
be used to set environment variables for the static pods. The set of
configuration available as environment variables is limited (proxy and log
levels). Future versions of {product-title} will remove this configuration in
favor of control plane files, so consider the *_master.env_* file a last resort
and deprecated.
